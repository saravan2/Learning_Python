We will explore how the concepts of conditional probability, Law of Total Probability and Bayes' Theorem help us better understand a simple survey. Along the way we will learn how the Python data analysis library `pandas` facilitates easy manipulation of data tables.\n",

We have collected real poll data  from the last 13 CNN polls, which can be found [here](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html) (link directly to the CNN poll [here](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2020/images/01/20/rel1a.-.trump,.impeachment.pdf)).\n",

Let $M$ be the event that a user answered \"No opinion.\" We are interested in estimating $P(A)$, however that is hard given the small but significant number of users who answered \"No opinion\". \n",
